    <p><em>A recent magna cum laude college graduate with a B.A. in Psychology looking to become a Data Analyst.  My interest in Data Analysis arose from dataâ€™s potential to influence decision making and potentially answering questions.

            My interest in answering complicated questions lead me to become a research assistant in two different research labs. This experience and interest in research fundamentally influenced me in conducting my honors thesis. I had to conduct my own study where I had to construct my own research design,
             recruit participants, and conduct my own analysis.
